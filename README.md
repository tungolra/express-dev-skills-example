### About 
An introductory assignment that demonstrates the use of Express middlewares and EJS. Users are able to create skills by inputting form data that includes the skill name. The completion status of new skills is defaulted to false. 

RESTful APIs are implemented to create, update, or delete Skills. Building this app demonstrates best practices using Express MVC architecture to modularize functions into routes, controllers, and models and client-side scripting into views. This app also leverages Mongoose's library to drive middleware functions.
